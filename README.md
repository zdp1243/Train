# Train

This assignment consisted of creating a train time table that is connected to Firebase.  It accepts
information about a new train/destination/first train time/train frequency from the form and adds it
to Firebase.  The current train schedule is then created from the data stored in Firebase and the 
times are updated with Moment.js.
